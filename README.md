# Home-Automation---Lighting Project

## Overview
This project aims to allow a TV Remote Control to turn light switches on and off. It consists of two main modules: an infrared signal sender module and a receiver module. 

## Sender Module
The sender module receives infrared signals from a TV Remote Control and communicates with the receiver module through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). 

## Receiver Module
The receiver module receives information from the sender module through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and controls two servo motors to turn light switch on and off.
